## tech stack

- html5 + css3 (vanilla, no frameworks)  
- vanilla js (smooth scrolling, intersection observer for fade-ins)  
- google fonts: DM Sans  
- pure css animations & transitions  
- fully responsive (mobile-first media queries)

intentionally lightweight: no build tools, no heavy JS libraries — fast load times and full control.

## key features

- fixed header with smooth-scroll navigation  
- animated hero section with character GIF and fade-in "hi" text  
- scroll-triggered section reveals  
- clean, lowercase typography-focused design  
- project cards with direct github links  
- simple contact section with multiple platforms

philosophy: **substance > style** — high-performance, secure systems mindset reflected in the site itself.
