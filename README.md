*(Add a real screenshot or short GIF here for better impact — use a tool like Lightshot, ShareX, or record a 5-second scroll)*

## Tech Stack

- HTML5 + CSS3 (vanilla, no frameworks)  
- Vanilla JavaScript (smooth scrolling, intersection observer for fade-ins)  
- Google Fonts: DM Sans  
- Pure CSS animations & transitions  
- Fully responsive (mobile-first media queries)

Intentionally lightweight: no build tools, no heavy JS libraries — fast load times and full control.

## Key Features

- Fixed header with smooth-scroll navigation  
- Animated hero section with character GIF and fade-in "hi" text  
- Scroll-triggered section reveals  
- Clean, lowercase typography-focused design  
- Project cards with direct GitHub links  
- Simple contact section with multiple platforms

Philosophy: **substance > style** — high-performance, secure systems mindset reflected in the site itself.
